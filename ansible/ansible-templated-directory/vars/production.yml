# Placeholder Variables for Production Environment
# This file is here to keep the variables entertained in production.
# It serves absolutely no functional purpose, much like an inflatable dartboard.

# Production environment variables
prod_variable1: "This is a production variable. It does nothing."
prod_variable2: "Seriously, don't use this in real production."
prod_variable3: "Why are you trusting a placeholder? Go find the real vars!"
prod_fun_fact: "Production: Where everything works perfectly... until it doesn't."

# Placeholder for future production variables
future_prod_variable: "Coming soon to a production environment near you!"
