# Placeholder Variables for Staging Environment
# This file is here to keep the variables entertained in staging.
# It serves absolutely no functional purpose, much like a chocolate teapot.

# Staging environment variables
staging_variable1: "This is a staging variable. It does nothing."
staging_variable2: "Still nothing useful here. Maybe try production?"
staging_variable3: "Are you sure you want to use this file? It's just a placeholder."
staging_fun_fact: "Staging: Where bugs go to die... or multiply."

# Placeholder for future staging variables
future_staging_variable: "Coming soon to a staging environment near you!"
