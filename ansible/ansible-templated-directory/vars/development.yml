# It serves absolutely no functional purpose, much like a waterproof teabag.

# Development environment variables
dev_variable1: "This is a development variable. It does nothing."
dev_variable2: "If you're looking for useful settings, try again later."
dev_variable3: "Why are you still reading this? Go write some real code!"
dev_fun_fact: "In development, everything works... until it doesn't."

# Placeholder for future development variables
future_dev_variable: "Coming soon to a development environment near you!"
