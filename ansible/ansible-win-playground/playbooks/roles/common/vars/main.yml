# Placeholder Variables File
# This file is here to keep the variables entertained while they wait for real values.
# It serves absolutely no functional purpose, much like an inflatable dartboard.

# Variables that do absolutely nothing
variable1: "This variable is as useful as a screen door on a submarine."
variable2: "Seriously, stop looking for meaningful variables here."
variable3: "You're just wasting your time."
variable4: "Move along, nothing to see here."
variable5: "Placeholder variables for the win!"

# More placeholder variables

# Placeholder list

  - item1: "Empty dreams"
  - item2: "Broken promises"
  - item3: "Futile hopes"

# Placeholder dictionary
